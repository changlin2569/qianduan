        <p>The sparrow outside the window talks a lot on the telephone pole, you say this, it feels summery, the pencil
            in your hand, back and forth on the paper, I use a few lines to describe who you are to me, the taste of
            saury, cat I want to know that the scent of first love was found by us, the warm sunshine, like freshly
            picked bright strawberries, you say you can’t bear to eat this feeling, it’s raining all night, my love
            overflows Like rain, fallen leaves in the yard, thick with my thoughts, a few words of right and wrong,
            can’t cool my enthusiasm, you appear on every page of my poem, under the rain all night, my love overflows
            like Rain, windowsill butterflies, like beautiful chapters flying in a poem</p>
